/**
 * # Approach 1: Brute Force
 *
 * # Intuition
 * The problem requires finding the number of ways to assign `+` or `-` signs
 * to each element in the array such that the resulting sum equals the target.
 * The brute force approach explores all possible combinations.
 *
 * # Approach
 * The approach involves a recursive function that tries both adding and
 * subtracting each number in the array:
 * 1. Start from the first element and recursively try both adding and
 * subtracting the current number to/from the sum.
 * 2. Move to the next element and repeat the process.
 * 3. If the end of the array is reached and the sum equals the target,
 * increment the count.
 * 4. The base case is when the index reaches the end of the array. If the sum
 * at this point equals the target, increment the count.
 *
 * # Complexity
 * - Time complexity: O(2^n)
 *   - Each element in the array has two possibilities (add or subtract),
 *   resulting in 2^n possible combinations.
 *
 * - Space complexity: O(n)
 *   - The maximum depth of the recursion stack is n.

 * # Approach 2: Recursion with Memoization
 *
 * # Intuition
 * The problem requires finding the number of ways to assign `+` or `-` signs to
 * each element in the array such that the resulting sum equals the target.
 * Using memoization helps to optimize the brute force approach by storing intermediate results.
 *
 * # Approach
 * The approach involves a recursive function that tries both adding and
 * subtracting each number in the array:
 * 1. Start from the first element and recursively try both adding and
 * subtracting the current number to/from the sum.
 * 2. Use a memoization array to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant
 * calculations.
 * 3. If the end of the array is reached and the sum equals the target, return 1
 * as a valid way is found.
 * 4. If the end of the array is reached and the sum does not equal the target,
 * return 0.
 * 5. Before returning, store the result of the current state in the memoization
 * array.
 *
 * # Complexity
 * - Time complexity: O(n * t)
 *   - The time complexity is reduced from O(2^n) to O(n * t), where `n` is the
 *   number of elements and `t` is the total sum of elements.
 *
 * - Space complexity: O(n * t)
 *   - The space complexity is due to the memoization array which stores the
 *   results of sub-problems.

 * # Approach 3: 2D Dynamic Programming
 *
 * # Intuition
 * The problem requires finding the number of ways to assign `+` or `-` signs
 * to each element in the array such that the
 * resulting sum equals the target. Using dynamic programming helps to
 * efficiently calculate the number of ways by keeping track of possible sums
 * at each step.
 *
 * # Approach
 * The approach involves using a dynamic programming table:
 * 1. Calculate the total sum of the array to determine the range of possible
 * sums.
 * 2. Initialize a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to
 * achieve the sum `j - total` using the first `i` elements.
 * 3. For the first element, initialize the DP table with two possible sums
 * (adding and subtracting the first element).
 * 4. Iterate through the array, updating the DP table based on the possible
 * sums from the previous element.
 * 5. At each step, for each possible sum, update the DP table by adding the
 * current element and subtracting the current element.
 * 6. Finally, check the DP table for the number of ways to achieve the target
 * sum.
 *
 * # Complexity
 * - Time complexity: O(n * t)
 *   - The algorithm iterates through the array and updates the DP table for
 *   each possible sum, where `n` is the number of elements and `t` is the total
 *   sum of elements.
 *
 * - Space complexity: O(n * t)
 *   - The space complexity is due to the DP table which stores the results for
 *   each possible sum for each element.
